# LSTM-playground

This contains the project that was developed during the S2DS workshop in conjunction with Stratified Medical in August 2015. 

## Objective

The main objective was to implement a deep learning deep learning neural network (LSTM-RNN) in Torch to teach machines how to read and comprehend medical articles.

# Results

We were able to implement a character prediction deep neural network model based on scientific papers. Also we were able to implement a sentiment analysis of movie reviews based on LSTM-RNN. Both of these implementations were prototypes that were incremental towards the implementation of the deep learning ePub Reader.
